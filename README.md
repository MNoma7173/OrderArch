This React Native application integrates with SaneAIbackend. In the domain.js file, users can specify their backend domain or IP address. This project serves as a prototype for implementing ChatGPT in food delivery applications, emphasizing the chat feature. Developed on Expo Go, the current UI is functional but not optimized, with primary emphasis placed on integrating and refining ChatGPT functionality. Future updates will prioritize enhancing the user interface for a more polished user experience.


Our project leverages Expo Go to create a streamlined ordering system that integrates seamlessly with ChatGPT, an advanced AI-powered chatbot. This innovative system revolutionizes customer interaction by allowing orders to be placed directly through natural language conversations with ChatGPT.

Key Features:

ChatGPT Integration: Customers can initiate orders by conversing with ChatGPT, which understands and processes their requests in real-time. This feature provides a user-friendly and intuitive ordering experience.

Order by Menu Option: For more traditional ordering preferences, customers also have the option to browse and select items directly from a menu interface. This ensures flexibility and caters to different user preferences.

Order Confirmation and Management: After placing an order through ChatGPT, the order details are dynamically updated and displayed in the OrderList.js component. This allows customers to review their orders and confirm accuracy before finalizing.

Review and Management by Admin/Manager: Admins or managers have access to a comprehensive backend where they can review orders, manage inventory, and oversee customer interactions. This ensures efficient monitoring and control over the ordering process.

Menu Management: Admins can update the menu dynamically, ensuring that the system is always current with the latest offerings and prices. This flexibility reduces operational overhead and enhances customer satisfaction by providing up-to-date information.

Technology Stack:

Expo Go: For cross-platform development and deployment.
React Native: For building a responsive and native-feeling mobile application.
Database: PostgreSQL (a commonly used relational database with Django ORM).
